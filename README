This repository contains a thermostat override based on NodeMCU, consisting of
two ESP8266 communicating via MQTT.

* first one (relay/) drives a relay to toggle the heating in my flat

* second one (dht/) measures the temperature in the coldest room

* additionally there's a service on the machine where the MQTT broker is
  running, which decides whether or not heating needs to be turned on based on
  the readings of the sensor
